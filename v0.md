Create a responsive navbar with the following tabs:
- Home
- Journal
- Mood Tracker
- CBT Coach
- Self-Care
- Schedule
- Resources
- Settings

Use modern Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components. The active tab should be visually highlighted. Include a mobile menu (hamburger icon) that toggles visibility of nav items.

Generate the component using React with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN Button and NavigationMenu components.
