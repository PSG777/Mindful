Design a minimal, emotionally resonant logo icon for a mental health web app called "Mindful" to be placed in the navigation bar beside the app name.

Requirements:
- Shape: Simple icon, compact, preferably a rounded or soft outline
- Symbolism: Should reflect themes of mindfulness, calm, growth, or clarity
  - Ideas: a small lotus flower, peaceful face outline, spark of light, abstract brain, or a soft heart shape
- Style:
  - Flat design (no gradients)
  - Soft edges (rounded corners)
  - Minimal color palette (light blue, soft green, or neutral gray)
  - Must look clean on both light and dark navbar backgrounds
- Size: 24x24 or 32x32 icon, easily integratable into `Navbar.tsx`
- Output: Generate a functional React SVG component or inline SVG block
- Tech stack: Should use Tailwind CSS if styling is needed, but prefer inline SVG

Generate this as a component that can be imported and placed alongside the text “Mindful” in a Next.js navigation bar component.
